**Project name:** CopyExampleGen component

## Project Description
CopyExampleGen will allow the user to copy a pre-existing Tfrecord dataset or raw data and ingest it into the pipeline, ultimately skipping the process of shuffling and running the Beam job. This process will require a dict input with split_names and their respective URI. This will output an Examples Artifact (same as the Artifact output from the ExampleGen component)  in which downstream components can use.

## Project Category
Component

## Project Use-Case(s)
CopyExampleGen will allow the user to add a dict input with split_names as the key and their respective pre-existing Tfrecords URIs as their value, then format the director structure so that it matches that of an Example Artifact.

Currently, ingesting data with the ExampleGen requires a Beam job to be ran and requires the data to be shuffled. This component will save users hours/ days of having to create a workaround fully custom ExampleGen component. Some challenges our users have had:
Reshuffle doesn't work well with DirectRunner and causes OOMing. Users have been patching out shuffling in every release and doing it in the DB query. They have given up on Beam based ExampleGen and have created an entire custom ExampleGen that reads from the database and doesnâ€™t use Beam. Link.
When the use case is a time series problem using sliding windows, shuffling before splitting in train and eval set is counterproductive as the user would need a coherent training set. Link.
Almost impossible to use ExampleGen based components for large datasets. Without it, Beam knows how to write to disk after transforming from input format to output format, allowing it to transform (slowly) large datasets that would otherwise not fit into memory. Link.

## Project Implementation
Use case #1 - Tfrecords as input URIs:
This component will:
1. Accept a dict i.e. {'split_name1': './path/to/split_name1/tfrecord1', 'split_name2': './path/to/split_name2/tfrecord2'}
2. Retrieve the tfrecords
3. Create an Examples Artifact, following Examples directory structure and properties required for an Examples Artifact
4. Register the Examples Artifact into MLMD
5. Output as 'examples' to be ingested from downstream components
